White paper of the country DRF - the world's first virtual country

DRF (Different Regultory Foundations) is a collection of regulatory Foundations that form a control structure called “From Center of Mass to Center of Mass.”
The world's first virtual country.

Management structure: Decentralized-hierarchical with cyclic feedback.

Economic system: the economy is a distributed economic system.
- The state regulates the economy through monetary policy and does not directly participate in regulating the entire economic system. Each unit of society initially possesses distinct legal, economic, and monetary powers.

The country's landscape and infrastructure style represents infrastructure carved from the existing landscape and virtual space with parameters as close as possible to the real world, with integrated artificial intelligence.

Self-sufficient, developing management system:

1. The Supreme Council is the highest governing body of the country, headed by the chosen Family Light from the founder’s family as the head for life, the founder is the head for life in the position of “Highest”. The head of the Supreme Council has the greatest powers within the DRF.

Consists of:
- Family Council
- DRF Fundation
DRF Token
DRF Pension Fund 
DRF Fundation (RIC) - regulated investment goods
The RIC Global Fund (GDP tokens)
- World Reserve Currency WRC
(non-market debt-free liquidity)

2. The Round Table is a governing and executive council consisting of Blocs, which is elected and headed by an approved Supreme Council and an elected representative from all regulatory bodies of the Round Table. Each Bloc is independent and has its own monetary and salary options.

Consists of:
- World Reserve Currency WRC
(non-market debt liquidity)
- Global Bank
- Diplomatic Block
- Economic Block
- Science Block
- Legal Block
- Digital Block
- Entrepreneurial Block
- Social Block
- Infrastructure Block
- Social Block
- Industry Block
- Judicial Block
- Other Blocks that can be added by the Round Table to provide a DRF management structure

3.Decentralized Community of Citizens - Council of Citizens, which is headed by a representative elected from the decentralized community of citizens based on the internal rules of the community.

Consists of:
- Accounting capitalization of the world (ACW)
- Community of Decentralized Goods
- Community “Your right limits My right”


World Reserve Currency (WRC):
A currency in equilibrium is a debt-issued currency with a limited emission principle, divided into market and non-market liquidity, where non-market liquidity increases in line with GDP growth less inflation.

1. Currency is issued into the market in line with GDP.
2. An equal amount of currency remains with the issuer.
3. The currency is divided into market and non-market liquidity.
- Non-market liquidity is divided into debt for the Round Council and non-debt for the Supreme Council.
- Market liquidity is used in international monetary relations within the market.

Debt-free: at the disposal of the Supreme Council
- can be issued for market liquidity
- can be withdrawn from market liquidity through a universal wallet tax (working with the world reserve and the correlation of price and purchasing power taken into account)
Debt:
- At the disposal of the Round Table
- Issued as a loan at a percentage determined by the Round Council.

Currency operation:

A universal tax is a tax on the wallet.

When lending currency by the Round Council and withdrawing it by the Supreme Council, the debt body is recalculated according to the amount withdrawn from the system, the interest remains unchanged (since when the Supreme Council withdraws liquidity from the market, market prices will be changed in favor of reduction, the debtor, having borrowed a large amount and throwing it into the economy, is obliged to return more than he can sell goods with new prices, so as not to worsen the debtor’s position, the debt body will be reduced by percentage withdrawal of money from the system through a universal tax).The debt amount will be reduced, interest will be recalculated
- The Supreme Council is obliged to return the missing amount of currency that was lent from non-market liquidity from the Round Table in favor of the Round Table, so as not to reduce the debt capacity of the Round Table.
- The Round Table, after withdrawal (repayment of debt), is obliged to return% of the debt in favor of the Supreme Council, so as not to reduce the overall non-market debt-free liquidity of the Supreme Council.

- The Round Table has the right to independently determine its own salary based on a salary rate of a percentage of the funds withdrawn through loans. The salary percentage increases based on increased efficiency of the entire system and increased non-market debt liquidity.

Thus, market and non-market debt and non-debt liquidity are absolutely controlled and can be in equilibrium with each other.

Increase in non-market liquidity:
Non-market liquidity will increase by % of GDP growth. With a general drop in market liquidity and a fall in GDP, non-market liquidity does not increase until the peak of GDP growth is overcome, taking into account complex inflation. If GDP grows but market liquidity decreases, GDP will be recalculated (a situation may arise where, with GDP growth, the amount of liquidity in the market will decrease and prices will fall, and technically GDP may show growth and fall in numbers, then the recalculation will be made without taking into account the decrease in liquidity as if there was no withdrawal).
