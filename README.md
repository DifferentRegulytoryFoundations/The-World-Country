World Reserve (TWR):
The World Reserve (WRC) is a commodity backed by liquid instruments designed to cover the inflation of world currencies and issued as a tokenized asset without the possibility of direct earnings by the issuer.

Original offering: World GDP at time of issue, valued in US dollars.
The total offer is unlimited
- TWR emissions are increased by the percentage of world GDP growth minus inflation once a year after receiving a full economic report on the global economy
- Market sale at the current exchange rate, based on the calculation that 1 dollar equals 1 TWR
- The market price of the TWR issuer is adjusted to take into account global inflation
- Combined collateral with debt and debt-free liquid instruments
- The issuer actively participates in the market without the right to receive income
- One-time 4% Fund Fee from the initial token sale
- Annual 0.05% Fund Fee for each year of token ownership (calculated and charged daily based on the token's net asset value)
- The issuer has the right to lend the asset independently

World Reserve Currency (WRC):
Currency in equilibrium value is an emission debt currency with a limited emission principle, divided into market and non-market liquidity where non-market liquidity increases according to GDP growth minus inflation.

1. Currency is issued to the market according to GDP.
2. An equal amount of currency remains with the issuer.
3. Currency is divided into market and non-market liquidity.

- Non-market liquidity is divided into debt liquidity for the round Council and debt-free liquidity for the Supreme Council

- Market liquidity is used in monetary relations within the market.

Debt-free: at the disposal of the High Council
- can be issued for market liquidity
- can be withdrawn from market liquidity through a universal wallet tax (working with the world reserve and the correlation of price and purchasing power taken into account)
Debt:
- At the disposal of the Round Table
- Issued as a loan at a percentage determined by the Round Council.

Currency operation:

A universal tax is a tax on the wallet.

When lending currency by the Round Council and withdrawing it by the Supreme Council, the debt body is recalculated according to the amount withdrawn from the system, the interest remains unchanged (since when the Supreme Council withdraws liquidity from the market, market prices will be changed in favor of reduction, the debtor, having borrowed a large amount and throwing it into the economy, is obliged to return more than he can sell goods with new prices, so as not to worsen the debtor’s position, the debt body will be reduced by percentage withdrawal of money from the system through a universal tax).The debt amount will be reduced, interest will be recalculated
- The Supreme Council is obliged to return the missing amount of currency that was lent from non-market liquidity from the Round Table in favor of the Round Table, so as not to reduce the debt capacity of the Round Table.
- The Round Table, after withdrawal (repayment of debt), is obliged to return% of the debt in favor of the Supreme Council, so as not to reduce the overall non-market debt-free liquidity of the Supreme Council.

- The Round Table has the right to independently determine its own salary based on a salary rate of a percentage of the funds withdrawn through loans. The salary percentage increases based on increased efficiency of the entire system and increased non-market debt liquidity.

Thus, market and non-market debt and non-debt liquidity are absolutely controlled and can be in equilibrium with each other.

Increase in non-market liquidity:
Non-market liquidity will increase by % of GDP growth. With a general drop in market liquidity and a fall in GDP, non-market liquidity does not increase until the peak of GDP growth is overcome, taking into account complex inflation. If GDP grows but market liquidity decreases, GDP will be recalculated (a situation may arise where, with GDP growth, the amount of liquidity in the market will decrease and prices will fall, and technically GDP may show growth and fall in numbers, then the recalculation will be made without taking into account the decrease in liquidity as if there was no withdrawal).
